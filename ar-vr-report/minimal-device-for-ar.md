# Special Case: Minimal Device for AR

* Augmented reality minimal devices is surprisingly simple to produce. It is in 
  fact very reachable with current technology. Something like tango phones. 
  TODO opaque screen,  depth sensors. Depth sensor is the newest. Kinect has
  been doing it for years. Leap motion is more recent but still is 2 years old.
  Now everybody seems to move in this direction
* What about a device like an iPad but with see thru screen. With some strong
  padding around the screen. Like iPad safe ghetto cover. The batteries and
  other hardware hidden in the handles. Style isn't too classy but it fits the
  utility look. And it is robust so for yet another utility requirement. 
* augmented reality is a lot easier when it comes to latency. Augmented reality
  content is likely something small in the middle of current reality. It
  allows see thru screen. No strong requirement on latency.
* Performance like 15 fps is usable in this specific context.

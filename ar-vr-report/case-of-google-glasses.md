# What about google glasses ?
* Google glasses is a very interesting case
* it was the first of this new wave of AR/VR Devices
* it got stopped recently without official reasons.

## Why google glass stopped ?
* Explain why google glasses has been stopped
* nobody knows as google didnt tell.
* Everybody is left guessing
* So Here is my guess.

**Reasons**
* They shoot for the moon and people were not ready
* a lot of mistake especially the elitiste distribution gaves them a very poor image
* people were scared of on privacy issues
* Obviously, it didnt help it was was from google. 
* The fact it was used in every day life didnt help on privacy either.

## What about the tech aspect tho ?
* they didnt do badly
* the 'faillure' of google glass seems more due to market conditions
  than due to technical grounds.

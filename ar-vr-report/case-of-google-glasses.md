# What about google glasses ?
Google glasses is a very interesting case when it comes about AR/VR devices.
it was the first of this new wave of AR/VR Devices.
Additionnaly it got stopped recently without official reasons.


## Why google glass stopped ?
Nobody really knows why google glasses have been stopped
  as google didnt tell.
Everybody is left guessing.
So Here is my guess.
In short, google shooted for the moon and people were not ready.

It had a very elitiste distribution. it gaves them a very poor image.
First the cost of 1500$, it is rather expensive.
Second it required google approuval.
you could not just buy it, google had to approuve you. 
This kind of distribution may seem ok for an experimental product 
But it is easy to see how people may perceive it as very elitiste.
 
Additionally the glass were supposed to be worn all the time.
It made people scared on privacy issues
For example, im in a restaurant.
Just a table away, there is a google glass user.
"is he taking pictures of me ?"
"is he browsing the internet to get personal information about me ?"
this kind of things

Obviously, it didnt help it was from google, very large organisation which
  know so much about us already.

## What about the tech aspect tho ?
They didnt do badly compared to others.
The tech is clearly not the reason why they stopped. 
the 'faillure' of google glass seems more due to market conditions
than due to technical grounds.

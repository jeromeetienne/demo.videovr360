About the naming of the AR/VR devices
=====================================
We got a bunch of devices.
Independantly of their respective performance, i wanted to think about
their names and their look. 
We put this device on our head. So its appearance is important.
It is about how user looks while they use the devices.

* [google cardboard](http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/)
* [occulus vr headset](https://www.oculus.com/)
* [gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gearvr/) from [Samsumg](http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxynote4/note4_main.html)
* [google glasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass) - now [stopped](http://time.com/3669927/google-glass-explorer-program-ends/)
* [skully motorcycle helmet](http://www.skully.com/)
* [daqri smart helmet](http://hardware.daqri.com/smarthelmet/)


## The Look

How the user look when they use the AR/VR devices.

* [picture of google glasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass#/media/File:Google_Glass_detail.jpg) - looks rather distingished, eleguant. you barely see them
* [picture of Gear VR ](http://casques-vr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/samsung-unpacked-gear-vr-4_2040_verge_super_wide.jpg) - quite large - make you look a bit like an cyborg.
* [picture of occulus vr headset](http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/occulus-vr-dk2-001.jpg) - the look is similar to Gear VR - quite cyborg
* [picture of daqri helmet](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qIU456jtkmw/maxresdefault.jpg) - made for industry - look a bit like a [bicyle helmet](http://www.cyclesportandfitness.com/airius-v15-argo-bicycle-bike-helmet-sale.htm)
* [picture of valve vive](http://media.bestofmicro.com/Q/A/483058/gallery/Vive_w_600.jpg) - similar look as gear vr or occulus vr headset. - maybe a bit more like [a bee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenter_bee#/media/File:Carpenter_bee_head_and_compound_eyes.jpg)
* [picture of google cardboard](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52536652e4b007332ef4ecf4/t/53c316cfe4b0b234f89bc5d0/1405294298036/) - definitive DIY look - you have to hold it with your hand at all time, may be tiring fast.
* [picture of skully motorcycle helmet](http://www.skully.com/) - futuristic - rather good looking - well aligned with motorcycle culture

## The Name
The Name of the device is how each device is actually called, 
independantly of its brand.
Is that glasses ? a head set ? an helmet ? 
We got *glasses* for google. 
Samsumg avoids the issue all over, by just calling it *gear*.
occulus goes with *headset*,
daqri and skully doing *helmets*.
and even *cardboard*!

Clearly no consencus there... but it doesn't matter that much :)

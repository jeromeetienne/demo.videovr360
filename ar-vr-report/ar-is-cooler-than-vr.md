# AR is Cooler than VR ?
*This text is **not** to be taken seriously* :)

Both terms, AR and VR, are hype at the moment.
But which one is cooler than the other ? 
Let's discuss this important matter.


At first, i was under the impression VR was cooler. 
I believed AR was too far fetch because it had all the troubles
  as VR and more, especially localisation of the user.
  So VR would happen before.
But i was wrong.

I now realize that VR is way harder from a technology point of view.
  It is due to the [latency issue](http://oculusrift-blog.com/john-carmacks-message-of-latency/682/)
VR requires to produce a device efficient enougth to fool
  the brain and how it handle your balances. 
This is not a absolute requirement for AR
AR can avoid it at first. 
  It can be delivered on current mobiles and tablets.
  So it is possible to have AR on today devices.
  This is a very important plus for AR.
Sure, AR will benefit from those fully immersive devices when they 
  become available.
  But until they do, it is still possible to have AR. 
  While VR is currently unreachable as current devices aren't
  efficient enougth (dizzyness, seasick).

Another thing is the scope. What is the content displayed in
  AR and in VR. 
  AR is about changing our reality, 
  it will affect our everyday lives.
  VR is about virtual worlds, it is about entertainment
  I would say, 'only' about entertainment, ok entertainment is big
  but it is far from being our whole reality.
  AT got a much wider scope,
  and will likely affect us more deeply than VR


AR is cooler because (i) AR is possible on today technology and (ii) AR scope is far wider than VR one. QED almost.

Yeah AR definitly cooler than VR! and im not biased at all because im doing AR :)

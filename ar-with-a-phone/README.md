- Thus people can go mobile, use it in the street, where they live.
- they can experience it thru glasses ala cardboard.
- they can experience without it too, by holding the phone in front of their eyes.

- draw 3d UI over this background
- use device orientation to controls the camera

- it see the 3d overlay which server as UI

**Now What to do with this UI**
